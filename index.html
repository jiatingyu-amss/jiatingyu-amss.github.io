              <p class="margin-bottom-24px-2">Networks are widely used in many fields for their powerful ability to provide vivid representations of relationships between variables. However, many of them may be corrupted by experimental noise or inappropriate network inference methods that inherently hamper the efficacy of network-based downstream analysis. Consequently, it's necessary to develop systematic methods for denoising networks, namely, improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of noisy networks. In this paper, we have explored the properties of network signal and noise and proposed a novel network denoising framework called Network Refinement (NR) that adjusts the edge weights by applying a nonlinear graph operator based on a diffusion process defined by random walk on the graph. Specifically, this unified framework consists of two closely linked approaches named NR-F and NR-B, which improve the SNR of noisy input networks from two different perspectives: NR-F aims at enhancing signal strength, while NR-B aims at weakening noise strength. Users can choose from which angle to improve the SNR of the network according to the characteristics of the network itself. We show that NR can significantly refine the quality of many networks by several applications on simulated networks and typical real-world biological and social networks.<br></p>

              <p class="margin-bottom-24px-2">As a classical problem in the field of complex networks, link prediction has attracted much attention from researchers, which is of great significance to help us understand the evolution and dynamic development mechanisms of networks. Although various network type-specific algorithms have been proposed to tackle the link prediction problem, most of them suppose that the network structure is dominated by the Triadic Closure Principle. We still lack an adaptive and comprehensive understanding of network formation patterns for predicting potential links. In addition, it is valuable to investigate how network local information can be better utilized. To this end, we proposed a novel method named Link prediction using Multiple Order Local Information (MOLI) that exploits the local information from the neighbors of different distances, with parameter that can be a prior-driven based on prior knowledge, or data-driven by solving an optimization problem on observed networks. MOLI defined a local network diffusion process via random walks on the graph, resulting in better use of network information. We show that MOLI outperforms the other 12 widely used link prediction methods on 15 different types of simulated and real-world networks. We also conclude that there are different patterns of local information utilization for different networks, including social networks, communication networks, biological networks, etc. In particular, the classical common neighbor-based methods are not as adaptable to all social networks as it is perceived to be; instead, some of the social networks obey the Quadrilateral Closure Principle which preferentially connects paths of length three.<br></p>

            <p class="margin-bottom-24px-2">This article provides an overview of the literature on mobility in developing countries. Explicit distinctions are drawn between directional and non-directional measures, absolute and relative measures, and combinations thereof. We note that the scarcity of panel data has hindered the measurement of mobility for many countries. We pay particular attention to the recent development of panel-free mobility measures, which allows us to measure upward mobility in 147 countries. We use these measures to revisit some central themes in the literature.<br></p>

            <p class="margin-bottom-24px-2">Increasing opportunities for students from historically disadvantaged populations and communities have been the focus of many different policies around the world. Yet, little is known about how these policy shape students&#x27; high school choices. In this paper, I examine whether a policy in Chile that mandated all institutions using the centralized system to incorporate a student&#x27;s high school-specific criterion affected students&#x27; ninth-grade school choice. I exploit the adoption of the policy and the local school market structure to estimate the effects of the college admission criteria on the quality of the school students attend. Preliminary estimation indicates that students in local markets with high scope for gains are two percentage points less likely to attend a high-quality public school. To study the effects of different policy changes in the college admission process, I follow Otero et al. (2022) and estimate a joint school choice and outcomes model.<br></p>

            <p class="margin-bottom-24px-2">We exploit a change in the college admission policy occurred in 2014 in Chile, a country with a centralized admission system, that increased the probability of relatively high achieving high school students moving from higher- to lower-quality schools (as measured by average standardized test scores) to study the effects of being exposed to highly motivated peers on academic outcomes. We use a strategy that compares 12th-grade students in classrooms that received more high achieving students with those from the same schools but who were exposed to fewer or no high achieving students. Using both basic and nonlinear-in-means specifications, we show evidence of heterogeneous effects depending on the ability of the incumbent students.<br>‍<br></p>
